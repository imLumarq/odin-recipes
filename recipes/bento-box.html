    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>½ cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>1 sheet nori (dry seaweed), or as needed</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons bonito flakes, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black sesame seeds</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon tamari</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tamari</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon wasabi paste</li>
      <li>¼ cup steamed broccoli florets</li>
      <li>½ cup cooked shelled edamame</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse rice with cool water until the water runs clear; drain. Bring rice
        and 3/4 cup water to a boil in a pot. Reduce heat and let simmer until
        water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Let cool, 10 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the sheet of nori into two 1-inch strips; reserve the remainder of
        the sheet for making tamagoyaki.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wet your hands and form the cooled rice into 4 equal portions. Keep your
        hands wet to keep rice from sticking. Create an indention in one of the
        rice portions using your thumb. Fill the indention with 1 teaspoon
        bonito flakes. Top with another rice portion to close the onigiri. Form
        into an oval shape and wrap the middle with a strip of nori. Make
        another onigiri with the remaining ingredients. Sprinkle white and black
        sesame seeds on top. Place in a bento box.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk together the eggs, mirin, and 1/8 teaspoon tamari together in a
        bowl; divide into 3 portions. Cut remaining portion of nori sheet into
        four 1/2-inch strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a small saucepan or square tamagoyaki pan over medium-high
        heat. Add 1/3 of the egg mixture and cook until almost firm, 2 to 3
        minutes; if omelette is too firm, it won't stick together very well.
        Slide onto a plate. Add the 4 strips of nori to the pan with some space
        between each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook another 1/3 of the omelette the same way, but roll it up carefully
        in the saucepan with the nori. Slide the rolled-up omelette onto the
        edge of the first omelette. Cook the third omelette and roll it up,
        sliding it on top of the second omelette. Let cool enough to touch,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the entire layered omelette together with nori inside. Cut into 4
        pieces. Place into the bento box alongside the onigiri.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix 2 tablespoons tamari, ginger, and wasabi paste together in a bowl.
        Put the mixture into a portable container then put inside the bento box.
        Add the steamed broccoli and edamame.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Cook's Note:</p>
    <p>Use fresh ramen noodles if possible.</p>
