    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup dried black fungus</li>
      <li>2 cups mirin</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups soy sauce, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>6 green onion bulbs, chopped, divided</li>
      <li>½ onion, coarsely chopped</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>2 pounds skin-on, boneless pork belly</li>
      <li>butcher's twine</li>
      <li>4 eggs</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup miso paste</li>
      <li>4 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles, or to taste</li>
      <li>4 sheets nori (dry seaweed), quartered</li>
      <li>1 naruto (fish paste stick with a red spiral pattern). sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place black fungus in a large bowl and fill with water.</li>
      <li>
        Combine mirin, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 3 green onion
        bulbs, chopped onion, and garlic in an oven-safe pot over high heat.
        Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pork belly skin-side down on a flat work surface. Roll up
        lengthwise and wrap with butcher's twine. Place pork belly in the pot
        with the mirin mixture and partially cover with a lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until pork is tender and an instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63
        degrees C), about 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a separate pot of water to a boil over high heat. Gently place
        eggs in the pot and cook until yolks are barely set, 8 to 10 minutes.
        Transfer eggs to a bowl filled with ice water. Let sit, about 1 minute.
        Remove from water and peel eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place eggs in a container with 1 cup water, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 2
        tablespoons brown sugar. Dampen a paper towel in the mixture and use it
        to cover the container. Refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the fungus and add to the liquid in the pot with the pork belly.
        Cover with a lid and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skim fungus from the top of the pork belly mixture and place in a pot
        with 8 cups water; fungus should be covered in pork belly fat. Add 1/4
        cup soy sauce and miso paste. Bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove skin from the pork belly using a knife. Chop the meat into pieces
        of desired thickness. Cut eggs in half lengthwise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Cook ramen in boiling water,
        stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, yet firm to the bite,
        about 3 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 4 slices of nori diagonally in the corner of each bowl. Place
        noodles on top; arrange 2 egg halves and a few pork belly slices in
        separate corners. Cover with black fungus, top with green onions, and
        pour in broth. Top each bowl with a few slices of naruto. Let sit, about
        3 minutes, before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Cook's Note:</p>
    <p>Use fresh ramen noodles if possible.</p>
